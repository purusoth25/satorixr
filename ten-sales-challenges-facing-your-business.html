                                <h3>AND HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP YOU OVERCOME THEM</h3>
                                <p>Joe is a rep for a litho offset printing machine manufacturer. He’s worked there for 15 years. During his time there, his company has hired multiple sales reps who have failed to meet or exceed Joe’s number of sales: they just don’t have his knowledge, experience or flair. With five weak sales reps and only one strong one, the business’s sales have slumped and the CEO is starting to feel the pressure. </p>
                                <p>You might not sell printing machines, but your sales challenges might be similar. You are desperate to increase your sales and are looking towards rapidly-advancing technology to improve sales, increase revenue, decrease costs and find more Joe’s without spending 15 years training them. </p>
                                <p>Which leads us to the question: Can technology increase your sales by 10x or more?</p>
                                <p>The age-old stereotype of a pushy salesman who travels door-to-door with a briefcase is long gone. In today's age, closing a sale requires far more than a salesperson (even a good one). </p>

                            <p>Joe and his team (like you) know that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/03/02/how-technology-is-changing-the-job-of-the-sales-professional/?sh=7a82da0f2572" target="_blank">the volume of leads does, in no way, determine their value.</a> You can have thousands of leads that you might send campaigns to with very little effect or response. Today, advancements in technology allows sales teams to gain a better understanding of their leads - without the knowledge that AI algorithms and platforms like <a href="https://knowyourcustomer.com/" target="_blank">Know Your Customer</a> provide, sales teams can consistently isolate leads by approaching them the wrong way, with the wrong information. One thing that will always remain critical is knowing when to say what to who and when, whether approaching a lead or closing a sale, and technology can help your team do this. </p>

                            <p>This may come as a surprise for many of you, but when we mention ‘outdated customer catalogs’, we are not only talking about printed sales materials like brochures or product booklets. We are also talking about online catalogs. While selling a service can be done online, prospective clients often find printed and online catalogs of actual, physical, three-dimensional objects to be: </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>Advocating for cloud-adoption is essential when it comes to ensuring that sales employees are able to sell their full potential - because content is available 24/7 from anywhere in the world. They don’t have to drive back to the office to pick anything up. </p>
                            <p>By now, it is unlikely that your company is running without the use of cloud technologies like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-za/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage" target="_blank">Google Drive, One Drive</a>  or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" target="_blank">DropBox.</a>  While these tools have dramatically changed the way that businesses work, a large number of businesses are not necessarily utilizing them to their full potential. While the cloud is, for some, <a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-computing-statistics/" target="_blank">seen as a foreign entity</a>, we use aspects of it consciously or unconsciously in our everyday lives. </p>
                            <p>Analysts are predicting that <a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-computing-statistics/" target="_blank">100 zettabytes of data will be stored on the cloud by 2025</a>, therefore, embracing the cloud and ensuring that employees are fully educated on the technology is necessary to not only boost productivity and sales, but to also protect your company’s data. </p>

                            <p>One of the biggest challenges facing sales teams who sell physical products such as machinery, mechanical parts, appliances and textiles, is the inability for customers to engage meaningfully with the product before purchase. While physical engagement with products before purchases may be optimal to many, Joe and his sales team are highly conscious of the expenses and impracticality that goes into lugging around their massive printing machines to every client meeting. </p>
                            <p>And with Covid, many clients are loath to visit the showroom floor in person anymore.</p>

After implementing these 3D catalogs into their sales routine, Joe and his team found that their customers enjoyed the augmented reality buying experience and also had a greater confidence in the choices that they made, reducing the chance of returns. </p>
                            <p>Digital Showrooms and virtual showrooms have also transformed Joe’s sales team, as he is now able to take customers on a virtual tour of each piece of equipment, click to expand key areas to ‘look under the hood’ and click on brochures and video assets along the way.</p>

                            <p>Automation has rapidly progressed over the last decade, giving companies like yours the opportunity to be more efficient than ever before. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/10/25/14-smart-ways-to-improve-your-customer-experience-using-technology/?sh=63d2c02f59e8">Automation in communication between customers and companies</a> in particular is becoming more and more important. Customers don’t want to wait for normal business hours for a response to a query or problem and the increased globalization of businesses in conjunction with time zones makes responding to every customer query or issue difficult for sales teams. </p>

                            <p>Utilizing technology that helps to close this gap, such as chatbots and automated messages can assist sales teams in dealing with queries quickly, and reduces the chance of a customer approaching another similar company that will respond faster. </p>
                            <p>Another useful element of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2016/06/13/ten-ways-sales-teams-can-use-technology/?sh=18c2ada96c5f" target="_blank">automation that can increase sales is through implementing follow-up emails</a>.

                                <li>Out of the six salespeople in the company, there was only one strong salesperson; the other five were considerably weaker with less experience </li>
                                <li>There were inconsistencies in product messaging by personnel </li>
                                <li>Options, add-ons and other configurations were often not offered to the customer due to lack of sales knowledge</li>

                            <p>Naturally this is the most cost effective solution for businesses however many manufacturing providers of EOM cannot rely on a simple ecommerce website that has flat 1 dimensional images on them, as the complexities behind each product need to be understood to avoid costly mistakes.</p>

                            <p>Between <a href="https://acviss.com/automobiles-industry" target="_blank"> 30-40% of auto components that are sold these days are fake</a>, and counterfeit products have a direct negative impact on sales and revenues. Creating awareness of this with customers and providing them with the tools that they can use to identify counterfeit products is essential. </p>
                            <h3>Technological Solution</h3>
                            <p>Fortunately, advances in technology are providing companies with the platforms they need to regulate goods and help both their company and their clients get exactly what they need and pay for. Applications like <a href="https://www.satorixr.com/satori-3d-catalog.html" target="_blank">SatoriXR’s Ecommerce Catalog</a>  help sales teams and customers with counterfeit control by: </p>

                            <h3>Sales Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Those selling physical machines know the challenge of having your customer visualize where the machine will sit on the floor or office or hospital room.</p>
                            <p>Imagine being able to show them, right then and there, how your machine is stacked vertically and not horizontally, taking up 75% less floor space than the competitors.</p>
                            <h3>Technological Solution</h3>
                            <p>The SatoriXR sales app allows the sales rep to point their ipad at any corner of the room or warehouse, and drop the machine there virtually - immediately showing how it would look and how much space it would take up. </p>

                            <h3>Sales Challenge</h3>
                            <p>The final challenge that Joe and his team identified was around product demonstrations. While we have already touched on the challenges around bringing products to the customer to interact with, demonstrations are different. While product demonstrations can be done by the sales team remotely or in person, advanced applications such as AR or 3D catalogs can be used to not only showcase a product but actually demonstrate how it works or what it does too. </p>
